# Hi, 

This repository is intended for my learning in other languages.
I will separate each language chosen for my study into branches.
At first i will leave the following: 

- [x] 1.TypeScript;
- [x] 2.NextJS;
- [ ]  3.Sass;
- [ ] 4.Emotion;


#### If you have any material suggestions to help me in the trajectory,
it will be very welcome!


# Happy Hacking!ðŸ––  
## and
# Enjoy a coffe â˜•
